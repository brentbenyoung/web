The Design Export folder contains exported (or sliced) graphics for developers. 

This could be anything from a header image to a button background. Developers use these graphics to build the final product. 

The graphics are grouped in folders, and each of these folders carries the name of a particular screen (for a mobile project) or page (for a web project).
